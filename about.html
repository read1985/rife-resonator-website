                    <h2>Our Company Profile</h2>
                    <p>Rife Health was founded already in 1999 by Gerard (Gerrie) Smit with the aim to manufacture and distribute Rife resonators at affordable prices. Rife Health was the first company in South Africa to locally develop and market electronic devices that were based on the discoveries of Dr. Royal Rife. Since then the purpose of Rife Health changed to make affordable, advance natural healing technology that includes ozone technology and health analysis systems, available to everyone at the lowest price possible.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 1999 an imported Rife-type resonator cost R18 000 (~€995). In the year 2000 Rife Health launched the Rife Wave Generator built under license in South Africa at a price of only R8 000 (~€440), making Rife technology much more affordable and available in South Africa (And internationally as the Wave resonator range is recognized as one of the best Rife-type frequency generators available on the market).</p>

                    <h2>Your Peace Of Mind</h2>
                    <p>In 2015 the company's name changed to Wave Technologies as more and more people recognised "Wave Resonators" rather than "Rife Resonators" as a brand.</p>
                    
                    <p>Gerard has traveled extensively to the USA, South Korea, the UK, Austria, Germany and Switzerland to obtain the latest technology advances and research results regarding resonance (Rife) therapy. Why buy from importers that have not invested in their product?</p>
                    
                    <p>Rife Health provides technology-based health devices such as electro-magnetic resonance and ozone generators that can be used in therapies to replace often dangerous medical treatments and ineffective medication. Rife Health's devices are based on the principles of natural healing and they are completely safe and have no side effects.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since 1999 Rife Health has been one of the main global suppliers of "Rife" devices. Quality devices and continuous after-sales support are part of the deal to ensure that customers have not only a healthier outcome but also have peace of mind about the reliability and effectiveness of their devices.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rife Health's instruments are tested and the best on the market and offered at the lowest prices possible. The Rife Health resonators have all the possible resonance therapy treatments stored in their devices. It includes the cancer cell destroying frequencies as discovered by Dr. Royal Rife and been reported on in the book "The Cancer Cure That Worked! | Fifty Years of Suppression" by Barry Lynes [1987].</p>
                    
                    <p>No investigating and experimenting needed anymore. Rife Health's devices are ready to use and loaded with the tested treatments that are effective (Most other Rife-type manufacturers have large lists of untested treatments from dubious sources on their devices). Because of the emphasis of frequencies that combat infections in resonance therapy, the Rife Health resonators can be used to treat in a complementary manner a wide variety of illnesses caused by infections, especially by Streptococci and Staphylococci.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Rife Health resonators' design and development are based on accumulated research data spanning many years. Not only did the designers and developers concentrate on the bio-resonance generation but also on the technological materials used in the generator. This broad front design approach forced them to give close attention to the user interfacing of the instrument as well. Making ease of use top priority. Even without instructions you will be able to understand the intuitive interface. The interface of all the resonators are similar of that of a cell phone. If you can operate a cell phone you can operate a Rife Health resonator.</p>
